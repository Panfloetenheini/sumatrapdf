## SumatraPDF Reader

SumatraPDF is a multi-format (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, FB2, CHM, XPS, DjVu) reader
for Windows under (A)GPLv3 license, with some code under BSD license (see
AUTHORS).

This is a modified version with rotate buttons in the toolbar. It would be nicer if this could be done in the config file, but this was faster.
